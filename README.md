# 🚀 Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### 🔹 `npm start`

**Runs the app in development mode.**  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  
The page will reload when you make changes.  
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

---

### 🔹 `npm test`

**Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.**  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

---

### 🔹 `npm run build`

**Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.**

- It correctly bundles React in production mode.
- Optimizes the build for best performance.
- The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### 🔹 `npm run eject`

⚠️ **Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

- If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.
- It will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project.
- All commands except `eject` will still work but will point to the copied scripts.

You don't have to ever use eject.  
The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you **shouldn't feel obligated** to use this feature.
